## Description

On a square grid of 15 boxes there is a gap that allows them to be moved to reconstitute a shape.

By increasing difficulty, it is proposed to put an animal form in order. At the start of the game the form is complete for a few seconds then a disruptive element wreaks havoc on the grid. You then have a little over three minutes to put everything back in order. From time to time the disruptive element tries to turn the grid upside down again by tapping on a square, if the one next to it is free then it will achieve its objective.

For each grid put back in place you get a gold, silver or bronze medal depending on your speed. The more you put the grids in the order, the more the difficulty increases, the grids are more and more disturbed and the shapes less and less obvious.

To give rhythm to your game, a soundtrack on the theme of the jungle accompanies you in addition to the effects of interactions. This game offers an exercise in memory, concentration and logic for ages 7 to 77!
